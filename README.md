# ☕ DCIT-50 Java Portfolio

> **A compilation of all Laboratory Activities developed during the DCIT-50 course.**

## 📖 Overview
This is my Java Portfolio. This repository contains a collection of laboratory activities and projects created for **DCIT-50 (Object Oriented Programming)**. These projects demonstrate my progression in learning Java, from basic syntax to advanced OOP concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.

* **Language:** Java
* **Course:** DCIT-50: Object-Oriented Programming
* **Professor:** Mr. Johnroe Camanaque

## 📂 Project Structure

Here is a breakdown of the activities I included in this repository:

### 🏛️ 1. LibrarySystem
A management system for handling library operations such as borrowing and returning books.
* **Key Concepts:** Class relationships, method overloading, and object interaction.

### 📚 2. BookList
A foundational program designed to manage a simple list of books. This project likely focuses on array manipulation or `ArrayList` usage to store and retrieve book data.

### ☕ 3 & 4. CoffeeShopRewards
A logic-based system for a coffee shop that tracks customer orders and calculates rewards points.
* **Key Concepts:** Conditional logic, calculations, and state management.

### ✅ Midterms Laboratory Activity. SmartHomeManagementSystem
A system that models electronic devices, allowing users to control their status, settings, and view their information using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
* **Key Concepts:** Polymorhism and Inheritance

### 🏫 5. SchoolManagementSystem
A program that creates a hierarchy where students and teachers share common attributes but maintain specific roles and data.
* **Key Concepts:** Inheritance and Polymorphism.

### 🏠 6. SmartHomeControlSystem 
Simulations of a smart home environment where users can control devices (lights, thermostat, etc.).
* **Key Concepts:** Interface implementation and device state management.

### 📦 7. MyOrderSystem
An order management simulation that handles product selection and cart management.
* **Key Concepts:** **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** were heavily used here to secure data and hide implementation details.


### ✅ Finals Lab Activity. ToDoListProject (Java Swing)
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that allows users to create, delete, and manage tasks.
* **Tech Stack:** Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel).
* **Goal:** To solve the problem of disorganized student tasks by providing a centralized tracking tool.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered
Throughout these activities, the following Object-Oriented Programming pillars were applied:
* **Encapsulation:** Protecting data using private fields and public getters/setters.
* **Inheritance:** Creating subclasses to reuse code (e.g., `Student` extends `Person`).
* **Polymorphism:** Overriding methods to perform different tasks based on the object type.
* **Abstraction:** Using abstract classes and interfaces to define mandatory behaviors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** **JDK 21**
* **IDE:** **VSCode**
