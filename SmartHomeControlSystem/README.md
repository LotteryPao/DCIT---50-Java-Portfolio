Laboratory Activity#6: Smart Home Control System 

 About this Project
This is a simple Java program I created for my Laboratory Activity. It simulates a smart home system where you can control different devices like an Air Conditioner, Lamp, TV, and Microwave.

The main goal of this project was to practice how to manage different objects (that share a parent class) using a single list.

 How it Works
1.  The program creates instances of devices (AC, Lamps, TV, Microwave).
2.  It copies one Lamp's settings to another using a **Copy Constructor**.
3.  It puts all devices into a list.
4.  A static method loops through the list to turn everything ON or OFF at once.
