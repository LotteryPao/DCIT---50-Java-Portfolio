Laboratory Activiy 3 and 4: Coffee Shop Rewards System

This Java program that I made  demonstrates the creation and management of objects using a custom `Book` class.

Key Features
Object Creation:Instantiated 5 distinct book objects with unique attributes (Title, Author, Year).
*Methods: Implemented methods to display details, update the current page reading progress, and modify author names.
Data Structures: Used an Array to store the objects and a Loop to filter and display books published after the year 2010.

## Concepts Applied
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors
- Encapsulation (Getters/Setters logic)
- Arrays and Loops
