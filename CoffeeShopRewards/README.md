Laboratory Activiy 3 and 4: Coffee Shop Rewards System

* This is my solution for the BeanBrew Coffee Shop lab activity. The goal was to create a Java program that acts as a rewards system for a cafe. I wrote code to handle customer transactions, track loyalty points for free drinks, and keep a count of all registered customers using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

* Project Structure
  - The system consists of a single Java file containing two classes:
    
* **Customer**: The blueprint for customer objects. It handles:
* Storing names and point balances.

* Tracking the total number of customers (Static).

* Logic for adding points and redeeming rewards.
