Laboratory Activiy 3 and 4: Coffee Shop Rewards System

* This is my system for the BeanBrew Coffee Shop lab activity. The goal was to create a Java program that acts as a rewards system for a cafe. I wrote code to handle customer transactions, track loyalty points for free drinks, and keep a count of all registered customers using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Project Structure: The system consists of a single Java file containing two classes
     
1. **Customer** -  The blueprint for customer objects. It handles:
      - Storing names and point balances.
      - Tracking the total number of customers (Static).
      - Logic for adding points and redeeming rewards.

2. **CoffeeShop**: The Main class that runs the simulation. It handles:
     - Instantiating objects.
     - Simulating transactions.
     - Displaying outputs to the console.
