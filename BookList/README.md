**Laboratory Activity #2: Working with Java classes and objects.**

This program that I made focuses on Class and Object implementation in Java OOP.

It demonstrates the creation and management of objects using a custom `Book` class.

## Features
* **Object Creation:** Instantiated 5 distinct book objects with unique attributes (Title, Author, Year).
* **Methods:** Implemented methods to display details, update the current page reading progress, and modify author names.
* **Data Structures:** Used an Array to store the objects and a Loop to filter and display books published after the year 2010.

## Concepts Applied
* Classes & Objects
* Constructors
* Encapsulation (Getters/Setters logic)
* Arrays and Loops
