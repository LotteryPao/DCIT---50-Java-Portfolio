Laboratory Activity #2: Working with Java classes and objects. 

This program that I made focuses on Class and Object implementation in Java OOP.

Key Features includes: 

Object Creation: Instantiating multiple book objects with constructors.

Attribute Modification: Using methods to update specific book details (e.g., changePage, setAuthor).

Data Filtering: Storing objects in an array and looping through them to find books published after 2010
